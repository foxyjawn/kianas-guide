				   <h5>Howard West</h5>
				<div class="bodytext">
					<p class="indented">Howard West is described by Howard University as an educational and career development initiative between the university and Google Inc. It includes a one-year residency at a Howard campus established at Googleplex, Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, California. This program provides computer science students an “opportunity to study and learn in Silicon Valley.”  This program also results in opportunities for recruitment for participants. I am a Computer Information Systems major; however, I plan to participate in this program by demonstrating my software engineering passion. This program would give me hands-on experience with a renowned tech company and the opportunity to learn from professionals in my desired career field.</p>

<p class="indented">“‘Howard West’ is now the centerpiece of Google’s effort to recruit more Black software engineers from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)—and to make them feel right at home here in Mountain View.”</p>
