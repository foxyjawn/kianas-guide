				<div class="bodytext">
					<p class="indented">Black Girls Code describes itself as an organization dedicated to increasing the number of women of color in digital spaces by inspiring girls of color to become innovators in STEM fields by exposing them to computer science and technology. They reach out to underrepresented communities through workshops and school programs to introduce coding lessons, from programming to game design, to bridge the digital divide and build confidence in black girls interested in technology.</p>

<p class="indented">As a black girl who codes, I would love to be a part of this initiative to teach other black girls the art of programming. I have acted as a mentor and mentee in various spaces, and I would enjoy sharing my journey with the next generation.</p>
