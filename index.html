			<p align="center">I coded this website from scratch to form this digital guide to achieving my software engineering goals. </p>
			<p class="indented">
Ever since I was a toddler, I have been fascinated with creation and technology. I have been a gamer, artist, and computer whiz since preschool. I lived in the digital universes of consoles and computers alike, and every screen was a portal that immersed me in the magic of malleable pixels. </p>
			<p class="indented">
My sophomore year, I joined my high school's robotics team because I presumed it was where technology and creation merged: they built robots. I only knew of the physical engineering process of creating robots, but nothing about how they came to life. So, when I received the opportunity to become a programmer on the team, I took it. There, I learned how to give robots brains using Java. I felt like I had gained a superpower. I decided to keep building my programming arsenal by studying languages like Python and HTML. Since then, I have created many digital products, including the one you're currently viewing.</p>
			<p class="indented">
Now, I am pursuing a career in software engineering because I still love creating new worlds, tools, and possibilities using technology. I want to leave the world with an app, machine, or virtual experience that will change people's perspectives on human life itself. To do that, I need to learn all that I can about code and what I can do with it. As long as I am always learning, I am always succeeding in my goal.</p>
