					<h5>Clean Code by Robert Cecil Martin</h5>
					<p class="indented">Clean Code is a book that teaches code etiquette by presenting various blocks of code, of which the reader is prompted to identify what is "good" or "bad" about it. Code can function while sloppy, but being able to code precisely and neatly allows collaborators to quickly understand the program from a software engineer's perspective. This book also provides advice on naming code elements such as objects, functions, and classes for better organization.</p>
<p class="indented">As I will have to present my programming projects to professors and colleagues, it would benefit me to have neat, readable, and organized code. As its description says, "this book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code."</p>
