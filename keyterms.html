					<h5>Project Management</h5>
					<p class= "quote">"Project management is the process of leading the work of a team to achieve goals and meet success criteria at a specified time."</p>

					<h5>Collaboration</h5>
					<p class= "quote">"Collaboration is the action of working with someone to produce or create something."</p>
					<p >Most coding projects will be split into sections for each programmer to work on to produce one finished product. I have to be a team player.</p>

					<h5>Problem-Solving</h5>

					<h5>Programming</h5>
					<p class= "quote">"Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task."</p>
					<p >There are about 700 programming languages, and 245 are considered notable. I have to know how to code in one or more programming languages to consider myself a programmer and create any digital product.</p>
					
					<h5>Software Development</h5>
					<p class= "quote">"Software development refers to a set of computer science activities dedicated to the process of creating, designing, deploying and supporting software."</p>
					<p >To build any coding project, I have to be organized and strategic in managing software development. As defined, there are different stages to producing any software, and I must have the skills to complete all of them.</p>
					
					<h5>Communication Skills</h5>
					<p class= "quote">"The ability to communicate effectively with superiors, colleagues, and staff is essential, no matter what industry you work in."</p>
					<p >I have to explain my code to other people and design it in a visibly digestible way for my colleagues.
</p>
					
					<h5>Data Analysis</h5>
					<p class= "quote">"Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data to inform conclusions, support decision-making, and discover useful information."</p>
					<p >I have to analyze data to conclude whether or not my code is fulfilling its purpose correctly. I have to know what is and is not working.</p>
					
					<h5>Innovation</h5>
					<p class= "quote">“Innovation is the creation, development and implementation of a new product, process or service, with the aim of improving efficiency, effectiveness or competitive advantage.”</p>
					<p >I need to create original solutions to new problems, solving them in the most logical way possible. That requires creativity and critical thinking.</p>
					
					<h5>Humility</h5>
					<p class= "quote">"Humility is freedom from pride or arrogance."</p>
					<p >I have to be willing to accept constructive criticism so that I can address shortcomings in my code and fix them. I must remember that I code to help others, not pride myself.</p>
