					<h5>Project Management</h5>
					<p>"Project management is the process of leading the work of a team to achieve goals and meet success criteria at a specified time."</p>
					<p > If I want to lead a coding project, I have to delegate tasks amongst a team and set effective deadlines that will result in a cohesive project produced in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
					
					<h5>Collaboration</h5>
					<p>"The action of working with someone to produce or create something"</p>
					<p >Most coding projects will be split into sections for each programmer to work on to produce one finished product. I have to be a team player.</p>

					<h5>Problem-Solving</h5>
					<p>"The process of finding solutions to difficult or complex issues."</p>
					<p >Coding is all about creating a technical solution to any problem. Even within that, I need problem-solving skills to debug the code.</p>
					
					<h5>Programming</h5>
					<p>"Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task."</p>
					<p >There are about 700 programming languages, and 245 are considered notable. I have to know how to code in one or more programming languages to consider myself a programmer and create any digital product.</p>
					
					<h5>Development</h5>
					<p>"The process of developing or being developed."</p>
					<p >To build any coding project, I have to be organized and strategic in managing content development. There are different stages to creating any program.</p>
					
					<h5>Communication Skills</h5>
					<p>"The ability to communicate effectively with superiors, colleagues, and staff is essential, no matter what industry you work in."</p>
					<p >I have to explain my code to other people and design it in a visibly digestible way for my colleagues.
</p>
					
					<h5>Data Analysis</h5>
					<p>"Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making."</p>
					<p >I have to analyze data to conclude whether or not my code is fulfilling its purpose correctly. I have to know what is and is not working.</p>
					
					<h5>Innovation</h5>
					<p>"Introducing new ideas."</p>
					<p >I need to create original solutions to new problems, solving them in the most efficient way possible. That requires creativity and critical thinking.</p>
					
					<h5>Humility</h5>
					<p>"Freedom from pride or arrogance"</p>
					<p >I have to be willing to accept constructive criticism so that I can address shortcomings in my code and fix them. I must remember that I code to help others, not pride myself.</p>
